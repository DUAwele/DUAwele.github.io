hi my name is David Utomi.
I decided to create a GIF search engin website using an Api source. 
I created an api URL link using GIPHY and consumed it.
Technologies used were .HTML , .CSS , and JavaSCript.

Simply search a word of your choosing.
Have fun.

ideas for future improvement.
Clock on top search for each timezone
Connect this page to a bigger api source capable or make it more like google
add more features
